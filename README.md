# Pre-work - ModestList

**ModestList** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Matthew Boyd**

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [x] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** My experience so far is mostly on the command line. However, it's considerably easier than laying out similar elements in a web page.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** The ArrayAdapter mediates between the data and the view, allowing the two to stay separate. According to the documentation, the convertView parameter allows a cached view to be recycled and populated with new data rather than have a new view be created.

## Notes

Didn't remember that a listener could be connected to a user interface element through the xml, had trouble figuring out again how that part was working from the tutorial.
